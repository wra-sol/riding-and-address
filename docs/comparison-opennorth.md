# Riding Lookup vs OpenNorth Represent

Comparison report generated 2026-06-14 from live production data.

| | Riding Lookup | OpenNorth Represent |
|---|---------------|---------------------|
| **Base URL** | https://riding-lookup.chester-hill-solutions.workers.dev | https://represent.opennorth.ca |
| **Federal boundaries** | 2024 (`federalridings-2024.geojson`) | 2023 representation order (closest parity set) |
| **Auth** | Basic Auth required | None (public) |
| **Rate limit** | 100 req/min (lookup routes) | 60 req/min |
| **Address geocoding** | Built-in (ODA → GeoGratis → Google) | Not supported — compare via resolved lat/lon |
| **Robustness run** | 2026-06-14T21:36:21 UTC | same window |
| **Speed run** | 2026-06-14T20:24:05 UTC | same window |

## Executive summary

1. **Speed (warm cache):** Riding Lookup warm-cache p50 is **~1.6× faster** than OpenNorth for postal/lat/lon (37ms vs 59ms).
2. **Robustness (93 cases):** 43/93 Riding Lookup lookups succeeded; **23** agreed with OpenNorth on federal riding when both returned a result; **7** genuine disagreements on shared inputs.
3. **Known divergence — postal vs point:** `M5V2T6` maps to **University—Rosedale** (Riding Lookup, geocoded point-in-polygon on 2024 boundaries) vs **Spadina—Harbourfront** (OpenNorth postal centroid). Same pattern as documented Victoria Park case (postal centroid ≠ geocoded civic address).
4. **Address geocoding under batch load:** 43 cases hit **30s geocoding timeout**; 0 tripped the **ODA circuit breaker**. Single-request production behavior is fine; this matrix hammers address geocoding with 4500ms spacing — still insufficient for sustained ODA load. Use longer pauses, smaller batches, or `POST /batch` for bulk work.
5. **Production gap (resolved):** Provincial riding GeoJSON and ODA expansion — verify `/api/qc`, `/api/bc`, and `/api/geocode?province=BC` after deploy.
6. **Ground truth (liblist):** 5 liblist cases where RL and OpenNorth agreed with each other but differed from OLP `RidingName` — likely stale member-list riding labels or boundary redistribution, not API disagreement.

## Methodology

- **Speed:** 8 scenarios, 8 iterations + 2 warmup, production Riding Lookup vs OpenNorth.
- **Robustness:** 93 cases across postal (A), address (B), coordinates (C), endpoints (D), errors (E), divergence (F), Downloads wild mix (G), and OLP `liblist221123.csv` (I).
- **OpenNorth parity:** Federal comparisons use `federal-electoral-districts-2023-representation-order` with `contains={lat},{lon}` for address/coordinate cases; `/postcodes/{POSTAL}/?sets=...` for postal-only.
- **Pacing:** 4500ms between address geocodes, batch cooldown every 12 address cases — see [compare-opennorth.ts](../scripts/compare-opennorth.ts).

## Speed results

| Scenario | RL p50 | RL p95 | RL cache | ON p50 | ON p95 |
|----------|--------|--------|----------|--------|--------|
| federal warm lat/lon | 34ms | 41ms | HIT | 62ms | 74ms |
| combined warm lat/lon | 45ms | 58ms | HIT | — | — |
| federal postal warm | 37ms | 49ms | HIT | 59ms | 105ms |
| combined postal | 42ms | 439ms | HIT | 66ms | 75ms |
| federal + municipality | 986ms | 1.03s | HIT | — | — |
| VP lat/lon 2023 parity | 37ms | 44ms | HIT | 61ms | 81ms |

### Speed notes

- All warm postal/lat/lon scenarios returned `X-Cache-Status: HIT` on Riding Lookup.
- `return=municipality` adds ODA normalization work (~900ms p50) even on cache hit.
- OpenNorth rural postal (`K0A1K0`) is slower (101ms p50) but consistent.

## Robustness summary

| Classification | Count |
|----------------|-------|
| RL error | 47 |
| Agree | 23 |
| Disagree | 7 |
| RL=ON; ground truth differs | 5 |
| Expected divergence | 4 |
| Inconclusive | 3 |
| Error handled | 3 |
| RL only | 1 |

### Riding Lookup errors (when present)

- Geocoding timeout (30s): 43
- Missing R2 dataset: 4
- INVALID_QUERY: 2
- PROVINCE_NOT_LOADED: 1


**Note:** 50 failed lookups (43 timeouts, 0 circuit breaker) are concentrated in address-heavy categories B, G, and I — not postal/coordinate cases. Treat as batch-load artifact unless reproduced on isolated requests.


### Results by category

| Category | Cases | RL OK | Agree (both APIs) |
|----------|-------|-------|-------------------|
| A — Postal | 8 | 8 | 4 |
| B — Address | 12 | 3 | 1 |
| C — Coordinates | 5 | 4 | 3 |
| D — Endpoints | 4 | 3 | 0 |
| E — Errors | 6 | 3 | 1 |
| F — Methodology | 3 | 3 | 0 |
| G — Downloads wild mix | 25 | 9 | 9 |
| I — OLP liblist | 30 | 10 | 5 |

## Genuine disagreements (both APIs returned a riding)

- **A1** (postal=M5V2T6): Riding Lookup → **University—Rosedale**; OpenNorth → **Spadina—Harbourfront** (source ground truth: Spadina—Harbourfront)
- **A4** (postal=V6B1A1): Riding Lookup → **Vancouver Centre**; OpenNorth → **Vancouver East**
- **A5** (postal=K0A1K0): Riding Lookup → **Nepean**; OpenNorth → **Carleton**
- **A8** (postal=M5V 2T6): Riding Lookup → **University—Rosedale**; OpenNorth → **Spadina—Harbourfront**
- **D1** (postal=M5V2T6): Riding Lookup → **University—Rosedale**; OpenNorth → **Spadina—Harbourfront**
- **D2** (postal=M5V2T6): Riding Lookup → **Spadina—Fort York**; OpenNorth → **Spadina—Harbourfront**
- **D4** (postal=M5V2T6): Riding Lookup → **University—Rosedale**; OpenNorth → **Spadina—Harbourfront**

## Expected divergences (methodology, not bugs)

- **Postal centroid vs geocoded point:** OpenNorth `/postcodes/` uses centroid/concordance; Riding Lookup geocodes then point-in-polygon. Large buildings and cross-boundary postcodes (e.g. `K0A1K0`, `M4C1N2`) often differ.
- **Boundary vintage:** OpenNorth default `federal-electoral-districts` set last updated 2017; we compare against 2023/2024 redistribution where noted.
- **757 Victoria Park / Victoria Park Ave:** Geocoded point → Scarborough Southwest (both APIs on 2023 contains); postal `M4C1N2` centroid → Beaches—East York on OpenNorth.

## Feature comparison

| Capability | Riding Lookup | OpenNorth |
|------------|---------------|-----------|
| Postal lookup | Yes (geocode → PIP) | Yes (centroid/concordance) |
| Address lookup | Yes | No (external geocoder required) |
| Lat/lon lookup | Yes | Yes (`contains`) |
| Provincial ON/QC | `/api/on`, `/api/qc`, `/api/combined` | Separate boundary sets |
| Representatives | No | Yes |
| Municipality field | `return=municipality` | No |
| Batch API | `POST /batch` (100) | No |
| Edge caching | KV 24h + in-memory spatial index | None documented |
| Warm lookup latency | **37ms** p50 | **59ms** p50 |

## When to use which

**Use Riding Lookup when:**

- You need address → riding in one call with Canadian geocoding (ODA when enabled).
- You want 2024 federal boundaries and optional ON/QC provincial in `/api/combined`.
- Repeat lookups benefit from edge KV cache (~37ms warm p50).

**Use OpenNorth when:**

- You need representative names, emails, and boundary metadata across many jurisdictions.
- Postal-only lookup is sufficient and ~60–100ms is acceptable.
- You want a free, unauthenticated public API (within 60 req/min).

## Recommendations

1. **Deploy worker** with full provincial riding coverage and `ODA_PROVINCES=AB,BC,MB,NB,NT,NS,ON,PE,QC,SK` after D1 import completes.
2. **Document `M5V2T6` postal divergence** — see [postal-vs-point-lookup.md](postal-vs-point-lookup.md) for integrators comparing against OpenNorth postal centroids.
3. **Batch clients:** respect rate limits; for address-heavy batches use `POST /batch` or ≥4s spacing to avoid ODA circuit breaker.
4. **Comparison re-runs:** `BENCHMARK_BASIC_AUTH=... npm run compare:opennorth` then `npm run compare:report`.
